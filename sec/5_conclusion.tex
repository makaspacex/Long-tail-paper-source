\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we found that the similarity of character components can be exploited to improve performance in the tail of long-tail distribution data, which can improve the performance of new characters. 
Furthermore, We implemented a spindle network to enhance the ability to extract character component features, leveraging the similarities between character components to improve the recognition performance of new characters. Additional analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SpindleNet.
Experiments on three challenging Chinese ancient book datasets (TKH, MTH1000, and MTH1200) to validate the superiority of our proposed method. The results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in this field.
In the future, we plan to train our framework in a weakly-supervised manner, which has proven to be successful in the scene text field.
